# Calculated Columns (Deprecated)

To create calculated fields fields on your datasets, use [Dataset Computed Columns](../datasets/core-concepts/core-concepts-3.md)[.](../datasets/core-concepts/#computed-columns) Note: Starting June 4, 2024, Calculated Columns will be deprecated.

Calculated columns allow marketers to create aggregations from other datasets.  For instance, being able to sum a transaction table and calculate the total spend of a customer.  These generated columns can be used in segmentation building or as attributes in syncs.&#x20;
