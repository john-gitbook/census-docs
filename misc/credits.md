  these exciting new Census features:
---

# Credits

* [GPT Columns](../datasets/gpt-columns/)
* [Enrichment Columns](../datasets/enrichment/) (coming soon)



When using credits, you do not need to set up any new connections. If you run out of credits (or at any other time), will also have the option to enter your own credentials instead of using the connection provided by Census.

You can always review your current credits balance by logging into Census and navigating to "Organization Home / Credits".

## Rates

Every Census sync that runs using enrichments will use up a fixed amount of credits based on the actino and the number of records processed:
