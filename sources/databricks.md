# Databricks

Databricks is a popular data warehouse for data engineering and data science thanks to its deep emphasis on Apache Spark, as well as SQL.

Census supports a wide set of Databricks deployments including
- Unity Catalog
- SQL Warehouses (including Serverless)
- All Databricks LTS versions up to and including 14.3, and new versions typically work without issue.

Census supports both [Basic and Advanced Sync Engines](/sources/overview#sync-engines) on Databricks.

If you'd like to skip these steps, you can use [Databricks built-in Partner Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/en/partners/reverse-etl/census.html) to set up a new connection to Census.
{% endhint %}

## Required Permissions

If using the Advanced Sync Engine and the CENSUS schema has not already been created, please create it by running the following:

```
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CENSUS;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA CENSUS TO <USER_YOU_PLAN_CONNECT_TO_CENSUS>;
```

Unlike many other SQL Databases, Databricks uses [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html) to grant external services such as Census access. You may want to create a specific user account for Census to use for auditing and access control.


## Configuring a new Databricks connection

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/RGtlCpXP-R8" %}

1. In your Databricks Account console, go the [Workspaces page](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/workspaces). Select the workspace you'd like Census to connect to and then click **Open workspace** in the top right.

2. Now within your selected Workspace, select **Compute** from the left menu. Census can connect to a SQL Warehouse or All Purpose Cluster. You can reuse an existing compute resource, or create a new one here. Click on the Compute you've decided to use.

3. You'll need to collect three credentials to connect to your compute:
    - Hostname
    - Port
    - HTTP Path

    For SQL Warehouses, switch to the **Connection details** tab.

    For All Purpose Clusters, in the **Configuration** tab, open the **Advanced Options** section at the bottom, then select the **JDBC/ODBC** section.

4. **All Purpose Clusters only** - Add the following configuration parameters to your cluster. These are also in **Advanced Options** section at the bottom under the **Spark** section.

    ```
    spark.hadoop.fs.s3n.impl.disable.cache true
    spark.hadoop.fs.s3.impl.disable.cache true
    spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl.disable.cache true
    ```

5. You'll also need to create your **Personal Access Token**. You can find this by clicking on your **Profile Icon** in the top right and selecting **Settings**. Then click the **Developer** option in the left settings menu and click on **Manage** next to Access Tokens. We recommend you create a new Access Token:
    - Name: Census (or some other details)
    - Lifetime: (clear the box) - This will prevent the token from expiring

6. Now you're ready to add the connection to Census. Visit the [Sources page](https://app.getcensus.com/sources) in Census, and click **New Source**, selecting **Databricks** from the menu.
    - Select the [Sync Engine](/sources/overview#sync-engines) you'd like to use. Note that this cannot be changed once the connection is created.
    - Provide your four credentials: Hostname, Port, HTTP Path, and Access Token
    - Optionally, set the Database Allow List. This will filter the SCHEMAS that appear in Census. Note that if you are using unity catalog, this filtering will apply across all catalogs.

6\. After the connection is saved, go ahead and press the **Test** button. This will validate that you've completed the above steps correctly. Once you've got a checkmark for all four steps, you're good to go!

## Allowed IP Addresses

If you're using Databricks's Allowed IPs network policy, you'll need to add these Census IP addresses to your list. You can find Census's set of IP address for your region in [Regions & IP Addresses](../basics/security-and-privacy/regions-and-ip-addresses.md#ip-addresses). Visit the [Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/network/front-end/ip-access-list.html) for more details on how to specify these IPs as part of your network policy.
