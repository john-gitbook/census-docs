This feature is only available for Census Embedded customers. Please reach out to support if you would like to request access.
{% endhint %}

Census allows you to customize the color of your Navbar as well as the "accent" color of the buttons & icons throughout your app. These settings are available to your Organization Admins, within the Organization Settings tab.

We provide a preview of your chosen theme on the right. We do recommend you choose dark colors, and that you avoid red or yellow for the accent colors.

An example with colors chosen:
