# PostgreSQL

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

This guide shows you how to use Census to connect your PostgreSQL database to your data warehouse and create your first sync.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.
* Have your database credentials ready.
* Have the proper credentials to access your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Azure Synapse](../sources/azure-synapse.md)
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Elasticsearch](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/elasticsearch)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
  * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
  * [MySQL](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/mysql)
  * [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)
  * [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)
  * [Rockset](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/rockset)
  * [Snowflake](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/snowflake)
  * [SQL Server](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/sql-server)

### Step 1: Connect PostgreSQL

* Once you're in Census, Navigate to [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations)
* Click the **New Destination** button
* Select **PostgreSQL** in the list

You'll be prompted to put the following credentials into the Census page.

![As listed, we need the Hostname, Port, Database, Username, and Password](<../.gitbook/assets/Postgres Module.png>)

## Connecting via SSH tunnel

Census supports SSH tunneling when connecting to Postgres as a destination. The setup instructions are the same as when using Postgres as a source.&#x20;

SSH Tunneling Instructions can be found [on this page here](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres#connecting-via-ssh-tunnel)



After clicking connect, Census will test the connection that was specified.

![A Green , means you are good to go](<../.gitbook/assets/Postgres Test.png>)

After the connection is verified all of your tables will be exposed, but please take a look below for more specifics. :arrow\_down:

## üóÑÔ∏è Supported Objects <a href="#supported-objects" id="supported-objects"></a>

We support syncing data to Tables in PostgreSQL, but they must have a uniqueness constraint on a column. ‚Äã

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** |                   **Sync Keys**                   |
| :-------------: | :------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|      Table      |        ‚úÖ       | Primary Keys or Columns with Uniqueness Constraints |

## üîÑ Supported Sync Behaviors

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about all of our sync behaviors on our [Core Concepts page](../basics/core-concept/#the-different-sync-behaviors).
{% endhint %}

|        **Behaviors** | **Supported?** | **Objects** |
| -------------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|           **Update** |        ‚úÖ       |     All     |
| **Update or Create** |        ‚úÖ       |     All     |
|           **Append** |        ‚úÖ       |     All     |
|           **Mirror** |        ‚úÖ       |     All     |

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support more Sync behaviors for PostgreSQL.

## ‚ùóÔ∏èCommon troubleshooting issues

You may be trying to sync to a table that does not have a uniqueness constraint. If possible, you need to add one to be able to sync to it. The syntax to do so is [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-alter.html#DDL-ALTER-ADDING-A-CONSTRAINT).
