# Google Ads

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

{% hint style="success" %}
Just a heads up: We use the new [Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/start) as opposed to the older AdWords API.
{% endhint %}

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Google Ads to Census.

## :question:Did my sync work? It says completed but it isn't showing the updated timestamp I expect.

The standard place where bulk files uploading update status doesn't actually update when using Census. Instead, you've gotta hover on a specific card.&#x20;

Steps to get there:

1. Open your google ads account
2. Navigate to Tools & Settings > Audience Manager
3. Hover over the name of your desired audience in the list.
4. Expand the section labeled `Customers based on email, phone, and/or mailing address uploads`
5. Within that, you'll see a `Last upload` label.

If that date isn't the same time as the most recent sync completed, please reach out via our in-app chat and we will investigate it with you.
