# Google Ads

## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

Connecting to your Google Ads account is straightforward.

1. From the [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations) page, click **New Destination** and select Google Ads from the menu.
2. Complete the OAuth flow. Make sure your are signed into a user account that has permissions to both view all of your accounts, as well as submit data to them (readonly accounts will not work).
3.  Select the Ads account you wish to use with Census. If you'd like to sync to multiple accounts, you will need to add each as its own destination.\
