# Google Campaign Manager 360

Google Campaign Manager 360 is a demand-side platform that allows advertisers to manage their digital campaigns across multiple channels.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

Census uses OAuth to connect to Google Campaign Manager 360. Before you start this flow, please make sure the user and accounts have the correct permissions:
- Your user will need access to the advertiser account you want to connect to
- The Campaign Manager 360 account is enabled for API Access
- Your User Profile permissions also have access to the API.
For more information, see Google's [documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/getting_started).

Once you've confirmed permissions, follow these steps to connect Census to Google Campaign Manager 360:
1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **Google Campaign Manager 360** from the menu.
3. Complete the OAuth flow to grant Census access. Note that you'll need to create a separate Census connection for each advertiser you wish to send data to.

### Conversion Identifiers

Each conversion record will need three things:
- A unique identifier that Census can use to identify new conversion events
- Conversion activity identifers
- Exactly one attribution identifier.

All conversions must be matched to existing activities by specifying the **floodlightActvityId** and **floodlightConfigurationId** values ([Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_overview#match_conversions_to_activities)). These will appear as required mappings.

Offline conversions must also be attributed to a specific user through one of the [supported methods](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_overview#match_conversions_to_activities), so you must add a mapping to exactly one of the following fields:
- Encrypted User ID
- Encrypted User ID Candidates
- Mobile Device ID
- Google Click ID
- Match ID
- Display Click ID

When using the Encrypted User ID, Encrypted User ID Candidates, you must specify Encryption Information in the sync's advanced configuration. See [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_upload#specify_encryption_info) for more information.
