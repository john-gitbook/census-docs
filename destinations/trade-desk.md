# The Trade Desk

In this guide, we will show you how to connect The Trade Desk to Census.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **The Trade Desk** from the menu.
3. The Trade Desk needs a few different types of credentials depending on which of the destination objects you intend to use. You can optionally decide which credentials to provide:

- For Ad Groups and/or Campaigns, provide the **API Token**. See [The Trade Desk's documentation](https://api.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/api/doc/Authentication) for more information on how to generate an API Token. We recommend you generate the long-lived token, and keep in mind that you will need to regenerate one whenver it expires.
- For Conversion Events, provide a **Postback URL**.
- For CRM Data Segments, provide the following:
  - **API Token** (as described above)
  - **Advertiser ID**
  - **Data Region** - One of: `US`, `EU`, or `APAC`. Census will create new CRM Data Segments in the region you specify here. You can create multiple The Trade Desk destinations in Census to sync to multiple regions.

### CRM Data Segment PII Normalization

Census will automatically normalize email and phone identifiers to the format expected by The Trade Desk. You can optionally provide Census with a pre-hashed email or phone number. If you do, you must ensure that the data is normalized to the format expected by The Trade Desk. Census cannot determine whether a pre-hashed email or phone number is correctly normalized once it is hashed.

For more details on how The Trade Desk expects email and phone numbers to be normalized, see [The Trade Desk's documentation](https://api.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataPiiNormalization).
